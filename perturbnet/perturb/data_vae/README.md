We provide examples of training cellular VAE models for datasets of sci-Plex (`sciplex`), LINCS-Drug (`lincs_drug`) and GSPS (`gsps`) with with and without unseen perturbations. 

A VAE model with all perturbations is used for evaluating FID score metric, and one without unseen perturbations is used for training PerturbNet.
